## Welcome to my GitHub pageðŸ‘‹

My name is Chirag Radhakrishna. At present, I am a graduate student at Santa Clara University. 

I value the daily interactions that I have with different Professors and fellow students. These interactions have been engaging, insightful, and creative which has given me opportunities to improve my fundamentals and widen my perspectives.

Large Language Models (LLMs), Online Social Network (OSN) Security, and AI ethics constitute my research interests. While AI has the potential to automate applications and complex tasks, I strongly believe that we need professional ethical standards to ensure AI products are developed the right way.
